How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
The code and software application were functional and secure because of the protection from the AES. I did a dependecy check.&nbsp;

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I did black box testing to secure each issues and vulnerbilities.
